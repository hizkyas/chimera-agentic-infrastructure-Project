# Project Chimera - Meta Specification

## Vision
Build a scalable factory for autonomous AI influencers that research trends, generate content, and manage engagement without human intervention.

## Core Constraints
1. Spec-Driven Development: No code without ratified specs
2. MCP Traceability: All actions logged via Tenx MCP Sense  
3. Swarm Architecture: Planner-Worker-Judge pattern
4. Human Safety Loop: Content approval thresholds

## Success Metrics
- Repository structure allows AI swarm collaboration
- All specs are executable (API schemas, DB ERDs)
- CI/CD pipeline enforces quality gates
